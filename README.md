# Linear-Regression
This repository contains two programs letting you perform Linear Regression in two ways, one with Scikit learn and one without scikit learn.
Along with the programs are two excel files letting you know what kind of dataset has been used. Also you can use your own dataset in these programs.
Just remember to include the name of your dataset in the program in place of the existing dataset names.
